# Implementing data caching for enhanced performance
This example is part of a recipe from the book published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us?utm_source=github):

[.NET MAUI Cookbook: Build a full-featured app swiftly with MVVM, CRUD, AI, authentication, real-time updates, and more](https://www.amazon.com/NET-MAUI-Cookbook-authentication-interactivity/dp/1835461123)

**In the book, this recipe covers:**
* Adding caching to the Repository and Unit of Work using the decorator pattern.
* Creating a caching service built on top of the [MemoryCache](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.caching.memorycache) class.
* Implementing a cache consistency mechanism: ensuring the cache is updated only after a successful data-saving operation.

**Note:** This example may not include all the points mentioned above. For complete details, please refer to the corresponding recipe in the book.
