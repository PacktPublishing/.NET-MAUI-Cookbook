# Implementing detail and edit forms
This example is part of a recipe from the book published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us?utm_source=github):

[.NET MAUI Cookbook: Build a full-featured app swiftly with MVVM, CRUD, AI, authentication, real-time updates, and more](https://www.amazon.com/NET-MAUI-Cookbook-authentication-interactivity/dp/1835461123)

**In the book, this recipe covers:**
* Building a complete CRUD flow.
* Displaying a detail form when tapping on an item.
* Starting the edit process on edit button tap.
* Managing item edits so unsaved changes arenâ€™t reflected in the `CollectionView` when editing is canceled.
* A communication pattern between the main, detail, and editing forms, fully compliant with the MVVM pattern.
* Reusing the same form for both creating and editing items, and customizing its appearance with a `DataTrigger`.

**Note:** This example may not include all the points mentioned above. For complete details, please refer to the corresponding recipe in the book.
