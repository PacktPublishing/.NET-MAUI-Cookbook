[.NET MAUI Cookbook: Build a full-featured app swiftly with MVVM, CRUD, AI, authentication, real-time updates, and more](https://www.amazon.com/NET-MAUI-Cookbook-full-featured-authentication-ebook/dp/B0DHV34WQ5)

## Before You Begin
Make sure your .NET MAUI environment is set up according to the official guide: [.NET MAUI Installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation?view=net-maui-8.0&tabs=vswin). Some examples also include an ASP.NET Core service, so ensure you have the necessary workloads installed: [ASP.NET Core Prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=visual-studio#prerequisites).

Additionally, it's recommended to move the downloaded folder closer to the root directory to avoid errors caused by long file paths.

## Book Description
Think about how much time you usually spend building an app in a technology you're still mastering. It often involves grasping new concepts, navigating roadblocks, and even rewriting entire modules as your understanding deepens. This book is designed to save you that time, guiding you toward creating a modern .NET MAUI application with expert-level quality.
It addresses a wide range of essential tasks and concepts needed for real-world apps, including UI best practices and advanced tips, MVVM, dependency injection, performance and memory profiling. Since real applications often go beyond frontend development, this book also explores integration with backend services for authentication, data processing, synchronization, and real-time updates. Additionally, youâ€™ll learn to implement multiple AI integration strategies - no prior machine learning experience required.

Mastery comes with practice, so the book is organized with step-by-step recipes, each tackling a specific task. Each recipe includes detailed explanations to help you apply the knowledge to your own unique projects.

By the end, you'll have the skills to build high-performance, interactive cross-platform applications with .NET MAUI - saving valuable time on your next projects.

## What You Will Learn
* Discover effective techniques for creating robust, adaptive layouts
* Leverage MVVM, DI, cached repository and unit of work patterns
* Implement CRUD forms with validation, local and remote databases
* Integrate authentication with a self-hosted service and Google OAuth
* Incorporate session management and role-based data access
* Tackle real-time updates, chunked file uploads and offline data mode
* Explore AI integration strategies: from local device to cloud models
* Master techniques to empower your app with platform-specific APIs
* Identify and eliminate performance and memory issues

## Who This Book Is For
This book is primarily aimed at developers who are already familiar with the basics of .NET MAUI. Whether you're actively building a .NET MAUI app or just starting to plan one, this guide will help you develop more efficiently and with better quality. Inside, you'll discover advanced techniques and practical examples to enhance your skills and tackle real-world development challenges. 

While a basic understanding of .NET MAUI and XAML is assumed, the recipes are presented in a simple, step-by-step format, making them easy to follow, even without prior experience. The only requirement is having your development environment set up, including Visual Studio or VS Code, .NET MAUI workloads, and an emulator or device for debugging.
