# Profiling the application
This readme file is part of a recipe from the book published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us?utm_source=github):

[.NET MAUI Cookbook: Build a full-featured app swiftly with MVVM, CRUD, AI, authentication, real-time updates, and more](https://www.amazon.com/NET-MAUI-Cookbook-authentication-interactivity/dp/1835461123)

**In the book, this recipe covers:**
- Setting up the [.NET Meteor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nromanov.dotnet-meteor) and [Speedscope](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sransara.speedscope-in-vscode) VS Code extensions for performance profiling.
- Analyzing a flamegraph performance chart.

This folder doesn't include specific examples because you can use any .NET MAUI application to try out the profiling technique described in the recipe.
