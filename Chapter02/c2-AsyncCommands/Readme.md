# Implementing asynchronous commands
This example compliments a corresponding recipe from the book published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us?utm_source=github):

[.NET MAUI Cookbook: Build a full-featured app swiftly with MVVM, CRUD, AI, authentication, real-time updates, and more](https://www.amazon.com/NET-MAUI-Cookbook-authentication-interactivity/dp/1835461123)

**The recipe in the book covers the following topics:**
* Creating a command that runs asynchronously without blocking the UI thread.
* Cancelling a command using a cancellation token.
* Displaying an `ActivityIndicator` based on the `AsyncRelayCommand.IsRunning` property value.

**Note:** This example may not include all the points mentioned above. For complete details, please refer to the corresponding recipe in the book.
