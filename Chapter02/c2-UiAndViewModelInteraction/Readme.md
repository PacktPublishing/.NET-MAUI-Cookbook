# Interacting with the UI from the view model without breaking MVVM
This example compliments a recipe from the book published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us?utm_source=github):

[.NET MAUI Cookbook: Build a full-featured app swiftly with MVVM, CRUD, AI, authentication, real-time updates, and more](https://www.amazon.com/NET-MAUI-Cookbook-authentication-interactivity/dp/1835461123)

**In the book, this recipe covers:**
* Sending a message from a view model and handling it in the view using `WeakReferenceMessenger`.
* Automatically scrolling `CollectionView` to the last item when a new item is added to the bound collection.
* Using a service instead of `WeakReferenceMessenger` for communication between the view model and view.

**Note:** This example may not include all the points mentioned above. For complete details, please refer to the corresponding recipe in the book.
