# Implementing ContentView with dependency properties to reuse UI elements
This example is part of a recipe from the book published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us?utm_source=github):

[.NET MAUI Cookbook: Build a full-featured app swiftly with MVVM, CRUD, AI, authentication, real-time updates, and more](https://www.amazon.com/NET-MAUI-Cookbook-authentication-interactivity/dp/1835461123)

**In the book, this recipe covers:**
* Creating a reusable `ContentView` with bindable properties.
* Binding the elements of `ContentView` to the properties defined in the view.
* Defining a `DataTemplate` and visualizing it using the [`DXContentPresenter`](https://docs.devexpress.com/MAUI/DevExpress.Maui.Core.DXContentPresenter).

**Note:** This example may not include all the points mentioned above. For complete details, please refer to the corresponding recipe in the book.
